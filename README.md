# Goal
This project demonstrates how to integrate Babylon.js into a GLFW application, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) using Emscripten. It covers setting up a hidden canvas element, initializing Babylon.js, compositing the hidden canvas into the native application, and proxying GLFW input events to the hidden canvas for seamless interaction.
